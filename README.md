# My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Science Learning Journey! This repository is a daily log of the topics I cover and projects I work on as I progress through my data science studies. The goal of this journey is to build a strong foundation in data science concepts, tools, and techniques, while continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects.

## Learning Resources

Throughout this journey, I am using a variety of resources, including:

- **Online Paid Courses**: 
  - Complete Machine Learning NLP Bootcamp MLOPS Deployment by Krish Naik
  - Data Science specialization by Coursera
  - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng

- **Documentation**: 
  - [Pandas ](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
  - [NumPy ](https://numpy.org/doc/)
  - [Matplotlib ](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
  
<!-- ## Projects

As part of my learning process, I am also working on practical projects, which will be shared in this repository. Each project will include a brief description, the data used, and the key learnings from the project.

- **Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Description: Analyzing a dataset to discover patterns, trends, and relationships.
  - Tools Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Project 2: Predictive Modeling**
  - Description: Building a model to predict future outcomes based on historical data.
  - Tools Used: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
-->  

## Goals

By the end of this journey, I aim to:

1. Build a solid understanding of data science concepts.
2. Develop proficiency in Python, SQL, and key Data Science libraries.
3. Complete a portfolio of data science projects.
4. Contribute to open-source data science projects.
5. Be prepared for data science job opportunities.
