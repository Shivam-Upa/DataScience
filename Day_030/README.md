This repository contains my work on web scraping using BeautifulSoup. The purpose of this project is to gather data from websites, clean and organize it, and then analyze or visualize the data for meaningful insights.

## Introduction

In this project, I explore the process of web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup library. Web scraping is the technique of extracting data from websites, and BeautifulSoup is a powerful library that allows us to parse HTML and XML documents, and navigate and search through them in a Pythonic way.

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- lxml or html5lib (optional parsers)

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas lxml html5lib
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```Python
Web_Scrapping/
│
├── data/
│   └── scraped_data.csv           # Example of scraped data
├── scripts/
│   └── scraper.py                 # Main script for web scraping
├── test.py                        # Script for scrape only one page content.
├── README.md                      # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt               # List of required libraries
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the project include:

  - **Switching to Scrapy:** For more complex scraping tasks and better performance.
  - **Database Storage:** Saving scraped data in a database like MongoDB for scalability.
  - **Dockerization:** Automating the scraping process using Docker.
